            <li>1 tablespoon vegan bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried parsley flakes</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>1 (12 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Dice tomatoes and return them to the can with their juice.</p></li>
            <li><p>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic to the hot oil<br>
                and cook, stirring frequently, for 2 minutes. Stir in diced tomatoes and their juice, tomato sauce, oregano, <br>
                1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper until well blended. Bring sauce to a simmer and reduce heat to<br>
                low. Let simmer while preparing meatballs.</p></li>
            <li><p>Combine beef substitute with bread crumbs, parsley, remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt, remaining 1/4 teaspoon<br>
                pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder in a bowl; mix until ingredients are well combined. Roll the mixture<br>
                into twelve 1 1/2-inch balls.</p></li>
            <li><p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally,<br>
                until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.</p></li>
            <li><p>Meanwhile, heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a deep skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add<br>
                meatballs to the pan and saute, turning occasionally, until all sides are browned and a bit crisp, about 10<br>
                minutes total. Reduce heat to low.</p></li>
            <li><p>Pour simmering tomato sauce over the meatballs and mix. Simmer sauce with meatballs for an additional<br>
                10 minutes. Serve meatballs and sauce over spaghetti.</p></li>
